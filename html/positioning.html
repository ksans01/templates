        <h1 class='title'>Best Types of Exercises for Older Adults</h1>
        <p class='date'>October 19, 2021</p>

        <p>It’s common to have some degree of muscle loss as you age — the process is called sarcopenia, and it starts in your 30s.

            It can affect strength, balance, mobility, and function. But there are exercises for older adults that can combat muscle loss and keep you strong for years to come.
            
            “There’s a great deal you can do to preserve muscle and bone strength and maintain your mobility well into later decades,” says Scott Kaiser, M.D., geriatrician and director of geriatric cognitive health for Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California.
            
            “Plus, physical activity brings a wealth of other benefits, including improved mental health, lower risk of chronic conditions, better cognitive function, and stronger heart and lungs,” he adds.
            
            As with any switch in your exercise intensity or routine, it’s crucial to start by talking to your doctor, Kaiser says.
            
            He suggests sharing ideas about the types of workouts you’d like to do, rather than just talking about exercise in general.

            You may have heard of zucchini cake, but have you tried the zucchini smoothie?

            (And if you're a licensed member of the "I hate vegetables" club, don't worry: you won't smell the taste of zucchini).
